        It's been a few weeks now, but the inspiration and buzz is still lingering. a higlight of my career was
        introducing <a href="#">Susan Kare</a> at a <a href="#">Dnbbble + Photoshop</a> meetup at Adobe's headquaters in
        San Franscisco. Last year, <a href="#">Rich</a>, Charles Pearson and some of the photoshop team had a braintorm
        meeting about doing another event together. I thew out something that time, seemed like a pipe dream and/or a
        long shot. "Hey, let's ask Susan Kare to give a short tolk. "I had just watched a <a href="#">video</a> of a
        presentation she gave and it was incredibly compelling.Miracuously, she said yes, even creating custom icons for
        the event. She went on to speak for 45 minutes about her journey as an artist and her pioneering work as the
        original icon and typeface designer for the <a href="#">originam Macintosh</a>. Her early work solidified many
        concepts that we all still see today: The wath, paint bucket, trash can, save etc as well as font and interface
        systems that inspired everything else that followed them.
